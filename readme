In this program we are trying to classify pokemon as either legendary or not legendary based on their types and stats. 
The pokemon data is contained within the pokemon.csv file. This file contains 800 rows and 13 columns. The features are 
the pokemons ID, name, type1, type2, total stat, health, attack, defense, sp atk, sp def, speed, generation, and legendary status. 

Our classification is done using an unpruned decision tree. The data is split into a train-test split using a 9-1 ratio. 
The model is evaluated using accuracy and AUC. 

The accuracy of our model was found to be 97.5%, while the AUC was 91%. This implies that the model is much better than simply 
guessing, and the accuracy is very high meaning the model is a good classifier.
